## Node Setup
In order to accept Tari, you will need to have a base layer Minotari node. You can either run it yourself, or find a node 
that has the correct GRPC methods exposed to the internet. It is recommended that you run your own node.

It may also be worth running multiple nodes as backups to ensure availability.

> NOTE: For end users, it is recommended to use Tari Launchpad which is built for ease of use. If you are not an exchange user, download [Tari Launchpad](https://tari.com/downloads) instead. For exchanges and businesses accepting
Tari, the recommended approach is to run the Tari binaries or compile from source.

> NOTE: For all servers connected to the internet, they must either be running a Tor client or configure public IP information. Documentation on this is available [here](https://github.com/tari-project/tari#README) and [here](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/discussions/6366). If you are running on Linux, the Tari applications have built-in Tor support, so this can be ignored.

### Section 1: Installing Minotari Node
> NOTE: If you are using a public `minotari_node`, you can skip this section

B1. [Install the minotari_node](https://github.com/tari-project/tari?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-using-binaries)

B2. Start the node:

```
minotari_node --init
```

B3. Start the node. 
```
minotari_node
```

B4. Press Ctrl+C to enter the command mode

B5. Type `whoami` and press enter. You'll see something like this. You should copy this data to a file for future reference.

```

```

B6. Restart the node.

### Section 2: Setting up a send and receive address

In this section we'll create a wallet address for receiving funds. 

> Be careful here, we'll be creating seed phrases that must be backed up and stored carefully.
If you are not familiar with seed phrases, you should probably stop here and ask for help. Get in touch with the Tari contributors 
if you need help

It's suggested you run this step on a trusted computer, that you know will not leak the information. Ideally, this computer should be entirely offline.

1. First, let's create a folder to hold all the wallet data.
```
mkdir tari_wallet_data
cd tari_wallet_data
```

2. Now let's run the wallet. Make sure that you specify the `--base-path` field to keep all the data in the above folder so that you can delete it afterwards.
```
minotari_console_wallet --base-path ~/tari_wallet_data
```
3. You will be asked if you want to mine. Choose `N`

```
Node config does not exist.
Would you like to mine (Y/n)?
NOTE: this will enable additional gRPC methods that could be used to monitor and submit blocks from this node.
```

4. Next, you will be asked if you want to create a new wallet, restore it, or restore from a view key. We want to create a new wallet, so we will __select 1__ here.

```
Console Wallet

1. Create a new wallet.
2. Recover wallet from seed words or hardware device.
3. Create a read-only wallet using a view key.
>>
```

5. Next we will be asked for a password. You will need to save this password for future use. Enter this password now and confirm it. 
> NOTE: You will not see the password as you type it.

```
Create wallet passphrase: 
Confirm wallet passphrase: 
```

6. You will now be asked if you want to use a hardware wallet. If you would like to, then select `Y`. This guide will assume you do not have a hardware wallet, so
most users will select `N` here

```
Would you like to use a connected hardware wallet? (Supported types: Ledger) (Y/n)
```

7. Next you will be presented with your seed words. You must write these down to be backed up in a secure place.

> This is a very sensitive step. Be careful not to leak data here


```
=========================
       IMPORTANT!        
=========================
These are your wallet seed words.
They can be used to recover your wallet and funds.
WRITE THEM DOWN OR COPY THEM NOW. THIS IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO DO SO.

=========================
<...............seed words will be presented here.............>
=========================

I confirm that I will never see these seed words again.
Type the word "confirm" to continue.
>>
```

8. When you have made a backup of these seed words. Type `confirm`.

9. You will now see the wallet. Press the right arrow twice to get to the `Receive` tab.

```

││Network Address:            /onion3/5bukgcjbadffcgspwkdeku6haqgvxo6oinf7vvjvzmzi33wbijjebqyd:18141 
```

10. Copy the details you see above. Most important is the `Tari Address one-sided` field. This is the address that users will send funds to for the exchange.

11. Press `f10` to exit the wallet

12. Next, we'll export the view key for the wallet.
Run

```
minotari_console_wallet --base-path ~/tari_wallet_data export-view-key-and-spend-key
```

13. You'll be asked for the password you entered in step 5.
```
Console Wallet

Enter wallet passphrase:

Press Enter to continue to the wallet, or type q (or quit) followed by Enter.

```
14. Copy both of these values to a safe space. We will be using them in future steps.

15. Press 'q' and `Enter` to exit the console wallet.

16. Make sure you have saved the above data. You can now destroy the folder `tari_wallet_data` and even the machine if you wish.

### Section 3: Setting up a read-only wallet to receive deposits

In this section, we will create a read-only wallet that will watch for funds received at the address saved in step 10. If you are integrating an exchange, this is 
how you can watch for received funds. 
> NOTE: This wallet we create will not have the ability to spend any funds, so you do not need to secure it as much as you do the spending wallet.

17. On a server machine that is connected to the internet. Run this command to create a wallet
> By default all data is stored in `~/.tari`. You can find all logs, config and data in there. If you would like to use a specific folder, you can use the `--base-path` folder.
```
minotari_console_wallet
```

18. You will be asked if you want to mine. Choose `N`

```
Node config does not exist.
Would you like to mine (Y/n)?
NOTE: this will enable additional gRPC methods that could be used to monitor and submit blocks from this node.
```

19. Next, you will be asked if you want to create a new wallet, restore it, or restore from a view key. We want to create a _read-only wallet_, so we will __select 3__ here.

```
Console Wallet

1. Create a new wallet.
2. Recover wallet from seed words or hardware device.
3. Create a read-only wallet using a view key.
>>
```

20. Next we will be asked for a password. You will need to save this password for future use. Enter this password now and confirm it. 
> NOTE: You will not see the password as you type it.

> NOTE: THIS PASSWORD DOES NOT NEED TO MATCH THE PREVIOUS PASSWORD CREATED IN STEP 5. It is suggested you use a different password here

```
>> 3

Create wallet passphrase: 
Confirm wallet passphrase: 
```

21. Enter the view key from step 17

```
Enter view key:  (hex)
cb6c13f07af23380c7756bbfcd622bc3277ec2cc42abd5ed3d8ddd19fa49060c
```
22. Enter the spend key from step 18

```
Enter the public spend key:  (hex or base58)
f29039796b3430c6927f26bf216b6241dd7fad7f30a6640e8ac95f3d0af51a52  
```

23. You should now see the familiar console wallet. We'll need to configure it a bit more, so let's close it now by pressing `f10`.

24. Browse to the config file under `~/.tari/mainnet/config/config.toml` and open it in your favourite text editor.

25. Find the section `[wallet]`

```toml
########################################################################################################################
#                                                                                                                      #
#                      Wallet Configuration Options (WalletConfig)                                                     #
#                                                                                                                      #
########################################################################################################################

[wallet]
# The buffer size constants for the publish/subscribe connector channel, connecting comms messages to the domain layer:
# (min value = 300, default value = 50000).
#buffer_size = 50000

# The relative path to store persistent data (default = "data/wallet")
#data_dir = "data/wallet"
```

26. Next, find the line `#grpc_enabled = false` and change it to `grpc_enabled = true`
> Remember to remove the `#` character at the start of the line.

```toml
# Set to true to enable grpc. (default = false)
grpc_enabled = true
# The socket to expose for the gRPC base node server (default = "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/18143")
#grpc_address = "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/18143"
# gRPC authentication method (default = "none")
#grpc_authentication = { username = "admin", password = "xxxx" }
```

> If you wish to secure the gRPC more, you can edit the other settings. It is important that the wallet's gRPC port is not accessible from the public internet

27. Set the wallet's base node. Set this value to the `minotari_node` you created or chose at the beginning of this guide in step B5.

> The format is `<public_key>::<public address>`. This is what it should look like using the example data from step B5. You should not use the data below, but insert your own details.

```toml
# A custom base node peer that will be used to obtain metadata from, example
# "0eefb45a4de9484eca74846a4f47d2c8d38e76be1fec63b0112bd00d297c0928::/ip4/13.40.98.39/tcp/18189"
# (default = )
custom_base_node = "90f67a04edcb36261e6304ca213629d183c44e26bd47e38c253473f44d901733::/onion3/f5qbkkfkoxowzvshe5mppzpgiiy76cwumpsacungeldoal6hehcgzfqd:18141"
```

28. Save the file and start the wallet again.

```
minotari_console_wallet
```

You are now ready to receive deposits. In the next section we'll list for incoming transactions.

### Section 4: Listening for incoming transactions

Depending on your process, we'll use the gRPC server that is hosted in the read-only wallet we just created to listen for incoming deposits. 

In this example we will use NodeJS. Reach out to us if you would like an example in your favourite language

```javascript
const grpc = require('@grpc/grpc-js');
const protoLoader = require('@grpc/proto-loader');

// Load the protobuf
const PROTO_PATH = './proto/wallet.proto';
const packageDefinition = protoLoader.loadSync(PROTO_PATH, {
    keepCase: true,
    longs: String,
    enums: String,
    defaults: true,
    oneofs: true
});
const streamingProto = grpc.loadPackageDefinition(packageDefinition).tari.rpc;

// Create a client
console.log(streamingProto);
const client = new streamingProto.Wallet('localhost:18143', grpc.credentials.createInsecure());

const request = {};

// Call the gRPC method
const call = client.GetCompletedTransactions(request);

// Handle the stream of responses
call.on('data', (response) => {
    console.log('Received data:', response);
    // ..... Do business logic with transaction. E.g. compare the reference in payment_id to a reference provided to the exchange client and allocate
    // to their account
    // ....
});

call.on('end', () => {
    console.log('Stream ended.');
});

call.on('error', (err) => {
    console.error('Stream error:', err);
});

call.on('status', (status) => {
    console.log('Stream status:', status);
});

```

### Section 5: An example for receiving funds

Each exchange will have their own processes, but here is an example of receiving funds from a KYC'ed client. 

1. The client begins the deposit process. For example, clicking on a "Deposit" button
2. The exchange generates a long unique ID for the deposit. This may be a single reference that is reused for the client, or every 
deposit may have their own reference.
3. The exchange provides their `Tari Address` (from step 9 of Section 3) and the reference to the client. The exchange must also save this reference in their internal database.
> Note: Exchanges should use the one-sided or non-interactive addresses instead of interactive addresses so that they can receive deposits even if their infrastructure is offline. Interactive addresses are intended for peer-to-peer transactions.
4. The client uses Tari Aurora or another Tari enabled wallet and sends a non-interactive transaction to the provided address. They must include the provided reference with this transaction.
5. A process similar to the example in Section 4, the exchange periodically runs the script to see if there are any new transactions
6. For new transactions, compare against the list of expected references in their internal database and if there is a match, call the internal system to allocate funds to the client's account.

### Section 6: Performing withdrawals

In this section we'll perform a withdrawal from the same address we used in section 3. It is also possible to have a number of different wallets and send funds between them. The process is mostly the same, but is out of scope for this document.

> NOTE: The wallet used to spend funds should not be online for more time than is necessary. It is recommended that the machine running this wallet is secured.

Before we spend funds, we must have a wallet set up with the seed words created in Step 7 of Section 2. 

Once the wallet is set up, continue with the steps below.

1. Run the wallet to update the balance

```
minotari_console_wallet --password <password> --p"wallet.custom_base_node='<node_pub_key>::<node_pub_address>'" --auto-exit sync
```

> TIP: The custom base node can also be set as an environment variable `TARI_WALLET__CUSTOM_BASE_NODE`

2. Validate there are sufficient funds in the wallet
```
minotari_console_wallet --password <password> --p"wallet.custom_base_node='<node_pub_key>::<node_pub_address>'" --auto-exit get-balance
```

```
Minotari Console Wallet running... (Command mode started)
==============
Command Runner
==============

1. GetBalance

Available balance: 10000.000000 T
Time locked: 0 µT
Pending incoming balance: 27960.980255 T
Pending outgoing balance: 0 µT

Minotari Console Wallet running... (Command mode completed)

```

3. Send funds to the desired address

```
minotari_console_wallet --password <password> --p"wallet.custom_base_node='<node_pub_key>::<node_pub_address>'" --auto-exit send-minotari <amount> <destination>

```
Replace `<amount>` and `<destination>` with the amount to send and Tari address to send funds to. 

> IMPORTANT: Exchanges should not allow clients to provide interactive Tari Addresses. This can be easily validated by checking the second byte of the address.
