# Tari Labs Privacy Policy

Tari Labs ("Company", "we", "our", or "us") recognizes that people who use our website, **desktop applications** and/or mobile applications (collectively, the "Services") value their privacy. This privacy policy (the "Policy") describes how the Services made available by Tari Labs collect, use, share, and store personal information of users of the Services. This Policy applies to the Services on or in which it is posted, linked, or referenced.

By using the Services, you accept the terms of this Policy and consent to our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your information as described in this Policy.  If you have not done so already, please also review our User Agreement, which governs your use of the Services. The User Agreement  contains provisions that limit our liability to you and require you to resolve any dispute with us via arbitration on an individual basis and not as part of any class or representative action. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR OUR USER AGREEMENT, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY OF THE SERVICES.

Please note that this Policy does not apply to information collected through third-party websites or services that you may access through the Services or that you submit to us through email, text message or other electronic message or offline.

If you are visiting this site from the European Union (EU), see our Notice to EU Data Subjects below for our legal bases for processing and transfer of your data.

## WHAT WE COLLECT

### Self-Custody of Personal and Transaction Data

We offer the Services to enable you to self-custody your Tari **tokens** and similarly seek for you to self-custody your personal information and transaction history.  Accordingly, the information we collect about you is very limited and generally for the purpose of providing and improving the Services we offer to you.

### Active Collection of Information

We may collect certain information that you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. For example, if you opt in to receiving communications from Tari Labs via email, we may collect your name and email address. We retain this information until you ask to be unsubscribed from our list(s). If you purchase any products from Tari Labs, we may collect shipping information (such as name and mailing address) from you in order to ship the products to you. We do not sell or otherwise transmit any such actively-collected personal information to third parties other than to third party service providers discussed in Section 4.

### Passive Collection of Information

When you use the Services, some information about your visit is automatically collected. This information includes your IP address, access times, browser type and language, and referring web site addresses.  We collect this information to troubleshoot technical issues, understand how visitors use the Services, provide an experience relevant to the general location associated with your IP address, and to make improvements to our website.

If you arrive at our website by clicking a link, then we may capture information that tracks your visit from that link.

### Collection of Telemetry and Miner Analytics in Tari Universe

If you opt in to allow Tari Universe to use analytics to improve your experience, we collect non-identifying system performance data to improve network efficiency and miner experience. This data may include:

*   Hardware specifications (CPU/GPU model, core/thread count)
*   Available memory and storage
*   Network throughput and bandwidth usage
*   Hash rate performance and runtime behavior

We do not collect any information related to your Tari (XTM) wallet, including:

*   Wallet balances
*   Transaction history
*   Private keys or seed phrases

If analytics is enabled, your anonymized application ID may be cryptographically hashed into the coinbase transaction of blocks you help mine. This allows us to measure contribution and performance without compromising your privacy or identity.

If you are logged into the Tari airdrop program, your airdrop user ID may also be included in the coinbase hash to support reward attribution. This inclusion is optional and is only used for legitimate network measurement and incentive purposes.

Your analytics preferences can be managed at any time in the Tari Universe settings. Participation is voluntary and not required to use the application.

We will only provide these third parties with your personal information to the limited extent necessary to deliver the services.

## INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER

The Company has offices, affiliates and service providers both inside and outside of the United States and in other countries. Your personal information may be transferred to or from the United States or other locations outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.

EU users should read the important information provided  below about transfer of personal information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).

## HOW INFORMATION IS SECURED

We retain information we collect as long as it is necessary and relevant to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy. In addition, we retain personal information to comply with applicable law where required, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our User Agreement, and other actions permitted by law. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

We employ industry standard security measures designed to protect the security of all information submitted through the Services. However, the security of information transmitted through the internet can never be guaranteed. We are not responsible for any interception or interruption of any communications through the internet or for changes to or losses of data. Users of the Services are responsible for maintaining the security of any user credentials or other form of authentication involved in obtaining access to password protected or secure areas of any of the Services. In order to protect you and your data, we may suspend your use of any of the Services, without notice, pending an investigation, if any breach of security is suspected.

## NOTICE TO EU DATA SUBJECTS

### Personal Information

With respect to EU data subjects, "personal information," as used in this Privacy Policy, is equivalent to "personal information" as defined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

### Sensitive Data

Some of the information you provide us may constitute sensitive data as defined in the GDPR (also referred to as special categories of personal information), including identification of your race or ethnicity on government-issued identification documents.

### Legal Bases for Processing

We only use your personal information as permitted by law. We are required to inform you of the legal bases of our processing of your personal information, which are described below. If you have questions about the legal bases under which we process your personal information, contact us at **privacy@tari.com**.

### Use of data

We use the collected data for various purposes:

- To provide and maintain the Services;

- To monitor the usage of the Services;
- To detect, prevent and address technical issues; and
- To provide you with news and general information about other goods, services and events which we offer that are similar to those that you have already used.

### Legal basis for processing personal information under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), Tari Labs' legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the information we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.

Tari Labs may process your personal information because:

- We need to perform a contract with you;
- You have given us permission to do so;
- The processing is in our legitimate interests and it is not overridden by your rights; and
- To comply with the law.

These processing activities constitute our legitimate interests. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impacts on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal information for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal information for activities where our interests are overridden by any adverse impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).

### Retention of data

Tari Labs will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

Tari Labs will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer periods.



### Use for New Purposes

We may use your personal information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy, where we are permitted by law to do so and where the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis for that use. If we have relied upon your consent for a particular use of your personal information, we will seek your consent for any unrelated purpose.

## YOUR RIGHTS

Under the GDPR, you have certain rights regarding your personal information. You may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal information that we hold:

**Opt-out**. Stop sending you direct marketing communications which you have previously consented to receive. We may continue to send you Service-related and other non-marketing communications.

**Access**. Provide you with information about our processing of your personal information and give you access to your personal information.

**Correct**. Update or correct inaccuracies in your personal information.

**Delete**. Delete your personal information.

**Transfer**. Transfer a machine-readable copy of your personal information to you or a third party of your choice.

**Restrict**. Restrict the processing of your personal information.

**Object**. Object to our reliance on our legitimate interests as the basis of our processing of your personal information that impacts your rights.

You can submit these requests by email to **privacy@tari.com**. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions. If you would like to submit a complaint about our use of your personal information or response to your requests regarding your personal information, you may contact us at **privacy@tari.com** or submit a complaint to the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction.

### Cross-Border Data Transfer

Please be aware that your personal information will be transferred to, processed, and stored in the U.S.  Data protection laws in the U.S. may be different from those in your country of residence. You consent to the transfer of your information, including personal information, to the U.S. as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Whenever we transfer your personal information out of the EEA to the U.S. or countries not deemed by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of personal information protection, the transfer will be based on a data transfer mechanism recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for personal information.

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal information out of the EEA.
