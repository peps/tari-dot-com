## 6. THE WALLET

6.1. Description

6.1.1. The Wallet is provided to you exclusively by the Tari Network and/or Tari Testnet. The Wallet is only capable of supporting XTM. Under no circumstances should you attempt to store virtual currencies in your Wallet that the Wallet does not support.

6.1.2. When you create a Wallet, the Wallet software generates a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive any XTM via the Tari Network. **YOU MUST STORE, OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICES, A BACKUP OF ALL WALLET CREDENTIALS, INCLUDING YOUR EMOJI ID, PASSPHRASES, IDENTIFIERS, BACKUP PHRASES, PRIVATE KEYS AND NETWORK ADDRESSES.** If you do not maintain a backup of your Wallet data outside of the Services, you will not be able to access XTM previously accessed using your Wallet in the event that we discontinue or no longer offer some or all of the Services or may otherwise lose access to XTM. We are not responsible for maintaining this data on your behalf.

6.2. Your Wallet

Your Wallet will generally be made available on a non-custodial basis enabling you to self-custody your XTM. Among other things, this means that:

6.2.1. As the owner of XTM in your Wallet, you shall bear all risk of loss of such XTM. Tari Labs shall not have any liability for fluctuations in the fiat currency value of XTM held in your Wallet.

6.2.2. You control the XTM held in your Wallet. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your XTM by sending it to a different blockchain address controlled by you or a third party. In the event you wish to transfer XTM into the Wallet, you may be prompted to set up a backup phrase in order to do so.

6.3. Risk Disclosures Relating to Your Wallet

6.3.1. In order to be completed, any XTM or tXTM transaction created with the Wallet must be confirmed and recorded in the XTM ledger associated with the Tari Network and/or Tari Testnet. The Tari Network and Tari Testnet are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which are not owned, controlled or operated by Tari Labs.

6.3.2. Tari Labs has no control over the Tari Network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details you submit via our Services will be confirmed on the Tari Network. The transaction details you submit via our Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Tari Network. We do not guarantee that the Wallet can transfer title or right in XTM or make any warranties whatsoever with regard to title.

6.3.3. Once transaction details have been submitted to the Tari Network, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction or transaction details. Tari Labs has no control over the Tari Network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.

6.4. Forks

In the event of a Fork or other network disruption, Tari Labs may not be able to support activity related to your XTM. In the event of a Fork, the transactions may not be completed, completed partially, incorrectly completed, or substantially delayed. Tari Labs is not responsible for any loss incurred by you caused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a Fork or other network disruption.

6.5. No Password Recovery

6.5.1. With respect to the Wallet, Tari Labs does not receive or store a backup of your Wallet credentials, including, without limitation, your Emoji Id, passphrases, identifiers, backup phrases, private keys and network addresses or transaction history. We cannot assist you with Wallet credentials retrieval. You are solely responsible for remembering, storing and keeping secret your Wallet credentials. Any XTM you have associated with such Wallet may become inaccessible if you do not know or keep secret your Wallet credentials. Any third party with knowledge of one or more of your credentials (including, without limitation, a backup phrase, wallet identifier or password) can dispose of XTM in your Wallet.

6.5.2. When you create a Wallet, you must: (a) create a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online service; (b) provide accurate and truthful information; (c) protect and keep secret all credentials for the Wallet; (d) protect access to your device and your Wallet; (e) promptly notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Wallet; and (f) use the backup functionality provided through the Wallet and safeguard your backup files. You agree to take responsibility for all activities that occur with your Wallet and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Wallet, to the maximum extent permitted by law.

6.6. Fees

Tari Labs does not currently charge a fee for the Wallet receiving, sending or controlling XTM. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future, and in such case shall display to you any applicable fees prior to you incurring the fee. Network fees (including, without limitation "miner's fees") required to use the Tari Network may apply to a transaction. We may attempt to calculate such a fee for you. Our calculation may not be sufficient, or it may be excessive. You may select a greater or lesser fee. You are solely responsible for selecting and paying any such fee and Tari Labs shall neither advance nor fund such a fee on your behalf, nor be responsible for any excess or insufficient fee calculation.

## 7. TARI TESTNET

7.1. By using the Tari Testnet and Testnet Wallet you agree to these terms and acknowledge and agree that the Tari Testnet and platform is in development and that use of the Tari Testnet is entirely at your sole risk. You agree to use the Testnet and Testnet Wallet for testing purposes only and understand that Testnet Wallets may be periodically wiped without warning. You further acknowledge and agree that all information and materials published, distributed or otherwise made available on the Tari Testnet are provided for non-commercial, personal use only.

7.2. No party involved in, or having contributed to the development of, the Tari Testnet including any of their affiliates, directors, employees, contractors, service providers or agents (the Parties Involved) accepts any responsibility or liability to you or any third parties in relation to any materials or information accessed or downloaded via the Tari Testnet. You hereby acknowledge and agree that the Parties Involved are not responsible for any damage to your computer systems, loss of data, or any other loss or damage resulting (directly or indirectly) from use of the Tari Testnet.

7.3. To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall the Parties Involved have any liability whatsoever to any person for any direct or indirect loss, liability, cost, claim, expense or damage of any kind, whether in contract or in tort, including negligence or otherwise, arising out of or related to the use of all or part of the Tari Testnet.

7.4. The Tari TestNet is not yet 100% complete or stable. The network may be restarted, possibly multiple times, causing all Testnet Wallets to be wiped.

## 8. tXTM

8.1. Your use of the Tari Testnet involves the use of tXTM.

8.2. Allocation.

Upon your successful creation of a Tari Wallet, you may be allocated an initial amount of tXTM. We may allocate additional tXTM to you at our sole discretion upon your request. We may at any time vary the amount of tXTM to be allocated to you.

8.3. Limited License.

You do not own any tXTM that you may be allocated or that you may otherwise receive. Instead, you receive a limited license to use such tXTM on the Tari Testnet. Tari Labs may terminate your license to use tXTM at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion without notice, refund, or compensation. Tari Labs is not responsible for replacing tXTM or providing you with any credit or refund in the event that your ability to use tXTM is terminated, lost or damaged, or for any other reason. You agree that Tari Labs will have no liability to you based on its exercise of its rights with respect to tXTM.

8.4. Usage.

tXTM may only be used for Tari Testnet system resources. Any tXTM allocated to you must only be used by you and not by any third party. All tXTM can be used solely for the TariTestnet within the Tari Testnet environment and you shall not use any tXTM or the Tari Testnet in any manner that increases your allocation or consumption of tXTM or Tari Testnet resources to the detriment of other users.

8.5. Temporary in Nature.

All tXTM are temporary in nature and can only be used for a limited period of time that is stipulated by us. We also reserve the right to void any tXTM allocated to any user any time as we wish.

8.6. Value.

tXTM has no monetary value and cannot be exchanged for cash, cash equivalent, or other tokens or cryptocurrencies. You shall not attach any value to any tXTM and you are prohibited from using any tXTM for any purposes other than to access and use the Tari Testnet. Without limitation, you must not, and must not permit any person to, trade tXTM with any third party for any purpose, make tXTM available for trade on any cryptocurrency exchange, offer tXTM for rent, lease, sale, or trade in any manner, or attempt to do any of the foregoing. The amount of tXTM received is subject to our sole discretion at all times. tXTM has no monetary value and may not be sold under any circumstances. Neither use of the Tari Testnet nor receipt of any tXTM thereon gives any user any right to receive XTM or anything else in the future (on the Tari Mainnet or otherwise). Your balance of tXTM on the Tari Testnet will not transfer to the Tari Mainnet.

8.7. Modification.

We may from time to time add, modify, or remove any feature, functionality, or usability of any Testnet Token.

## 9. AIRDROP PROGRAM

9.1. Description

We may offer you the opportunity to receive XTM at no cost (**Airdrop**), subject to the terms described in this section. The Airdrop Program is provided to you exclusively by Tari Labs. The XTM is delivered by us to you, but is manufactured, offered and supported by the Tari Network, and not by Tari Labs.

9.2. Terms of Airdrop Program

9.2.1. No Purchase Necessary

There is no purchase necessary to receive XTM in an Airdrop. However, you must have a Wallet. Although Tari Labs does not charge a fee for participation in the Airdrop Program, we reserve the right to do so in the future and shall provide prior notice to you in such case.

9.2.2. Timing

Each Airdrop shall be subject to any terms displayed in the Services.

9.2.3. Limited Supply

An offer to receive XTM in an Airdrop is only available to you while supplies last. Once the amount of XTM offered by Tari Labs in an Airdrop is exhausted, any party who has either been placed on a waitlist, or has completed certain additional steps, but not yet received notice of award of XTM in such Airdrop, shall no longer be eligible to receive XTM in that Airdrop. Tari Labs reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to modify or suspend any Airdrop requirements at any time without notice, including the amount previously advertised as available.

9.2.4. Eligibility

You may not be eligible to receive XTM from an Airdrop in your jurisdiction. In the event that you have multiple Wallets with Tari Labs, you are only eligible to receive XTM from an Airdrop in one Wallet and for one user.

9.2.5. Notice of Award

In the event you are selected to receive XTM in an Airdrop, we shall provide you with written notice of the pending delivery of such XTM. Eligibility may be limited as to time. We are not liable to you for failure to receive any notice associated with the Airdrop Program due to change in your contact information that was not updated by you prior to such time as the notice was delivered by us to you.

9.3. No Obligation

Tari Labs has no obligation to provide any XTM in connection with the Airdrop Program, even if participants have accrued a certain amount of rewards. Tari Labs reserves the right to withhold or revoke rewards and/or XTM without consequences.

9.4. Risk Disclosures Relating to Airdrop Program

You are solely responsible for researching and understanding the Tari Network and/or Tari Testnet subject to the Airdrop. You may not rely on any of our statements concerning the foregoing.

## 10. GENERAL RISK FACTORS

Your use of the Services requires you to bear risks for which we cannot be held responsible. We list some, but not all of these risks below:

*   a) Hardware, software or connections required to interact with the Tari Network and/or Tari Testnet might fail, succumb to malware, unauthorized access or malicious attacks. Third parties may obtain unauthorized access to the Services, including, but not limited to your public and private keys. Tari Labs shall not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Services, however caused.

*   b) Forks, unknown vulnerabilities in or unanticipated changes to the network protocol may cause losses to you or others. Tari Labs has no control over the Tari Network and/or Tari Testnet and shall not be responsible for any harm occurring as a result of the inability to reverse a transaction, and any losses in connection therewith due to erroneous or fraudulent actions.

*   c) The risk of loss of value in using Services involving XTM and/or tXTM may be substantial and losses may occur over a short period of time. In addition, price and liquidity are subject to significant fluctuations that may be unpredictable.

*   d) XTM and tXTM are not legal tender and are not backed by any sovereign government. In addition, the legislative and regulatory landscape around virtual currencies such as XTM and tXTM is constantly changing and may affect your ability to use or transfer XTM and/or tXTM.

*   e) XTM and tXTM transactions may not be reversible. Once you send XTM and/or tXTM to an address, you may lose access to your XTM and/or tXTM temporarily or indefinitely. For example, an address may have been entered incorrectly, or an address may belong to an entity that will not return your XTM and/or tXTM. XTM and/or tXTM mistakenly sent to an address we control may not be recoverable.

13.6. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL TARI LABS, ITS AFFILIATES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, BE LIABLE FOR: (A) ANY AMOUNT GREATER THAN THE VALUE OF THE XTM ACTUALLY DELIVERED TO US BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH A TARI TRANSACTION COMPLETED ON ITS DISPLAYED TERMS OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS, VALUED IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION; OR (B) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, INTANGIBLE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH AUTHORIZED OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE SERVICES, OR THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF TARI LABS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF, KNEW OF, OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. FOR EXAMPLE (AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE SCOPE OF THE PRECEDING SENTENCE), YOU MAY NOT RECOVER FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR OTHER TYPES OF SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, INTANGIBLE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL WE BE REQUIRED TO DELIVER TO YOU ANY XTM AS DAMAGES, MAKE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OR ANY OTHER REMEDY.

Tari Labs is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your XTM transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any virtual currency transactions.

14.3. Severability, Reformation

In the event that any provision of this User Agreement is unenforceable under applicable law, the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected.

## 15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR UNITED STATES USERS

15.1. Disputes

If you live in the United States (or, if you are a business, have your principal place of business in the United States), any dispute arising between you and us under this User Agreement or our relationship (whether arising out of contract, tort, statute or any other manner) shall be settled in binding arbitration, in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act under the American Arbitration Association's rules; provided, however, nothing in this Agreement will waive, preclude or otherwise limit your right to (i) bring an individual action in a US small claims court or (ii) file a representative action solely to obtain a public injunction.

15.2. Arbitration

The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the county or parish of your billing address, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The arbitrator shall apply the law of the state of **Tennessee**, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys' fees when authorized by law, and the arbitration decision may be enforced in any court.

You agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority to order relief, and you agree to abide by all decisions and awards rendered in such a proceeding, which shall be final and conclusive. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this agreement shall be entitled to reasonable costs and attorneys' fees. If the arbitrator(s) or administrator imposes filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. If a court decides that any provision of this section concerning Arbitration is invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and resolved in accordance with **Tennessee** law exclusively and the other parts of this section concerning Arbitration shall still apply. In no case shall the remainder of this User Agreement be affected. If the invalidity or unenforceability of a provision causes a dispute to proceed in a court instead of arbitration, the Parties agree that such court must be located in **Nashville, Tennessee**, applying **Tennessee** law.

15.3. No Trial by Jury

By entering into this User Agreement, you expressly waive your right to a trial by jury and right to participate in a class action lawsuit.

## 16. DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR NON-US USERS

If you live outside of the United States (or, if you are a business, have your principal place of business outside of the United States), any dispute arising between you and us under this User Agreement or our relationship (whether arising out of contract, tort, statute or any other manner), the courts located in **Nashville, Tennessee** shall have exclusive jurisdiction of such dispute, and will hear the dispute under **Tennessee** law.
